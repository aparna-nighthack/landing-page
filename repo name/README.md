## Setup and Installation

### Prerequisites

1. **Clone the Repository**

   ```bash
   git clone <repository-url>
   cd repo-name

### Optional Setup

If you want to run a local server, options include:

- Using a simple Python server (for Python 3.x):

  ```bash
  python3 -m http.server
  # Open http://localhost:8000 in your web browser

  http-server
  # Open http://localhost:8080 in your web browser
  ```

## Additional Notes
