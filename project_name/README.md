Welcome to the Project Name web application. This document outlines the structure of the project, how to set it up, and instructions for navigating the project.

## Project Structure

```
project_name/
│
├── index.html
├── styles.css
├── scripts.js
└── assets/
    └── logo.png
```

- **index.html**: This is the main HTML file containing the basic structure of the application, which includes a header, main content area, and footer. It makes use of semantic HTML tags and links to the styles and scripts for enhanced functionality.
  
- **styles.css**: This CSS file contains all the styles to render an attractive and responsive UI. It uses Flexbox and Grid for layout, ensuring the application works well on different screen sizes. The color scheme and font choices are designed for aesthetic appeal.
  
- **scripts.js**: This file manages interactions and dynamic behavior. It listens for events such as clicks and handles form validations. The content is loaded asynchronously using AJAX for better performance.
  
- **assets/logo.png**: This is the logo of the application, used in the header to maintain brand identity.
