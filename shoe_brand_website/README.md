Welcome to the "ShoeS" website project. This README provides a comprehensive guide on how to set up, run, and understand the architecture of the project.

## Project Structure

The project consists of the following files:

- **index.html**: The landing page of the "ShoeS" website. It includes navigation links to the login and signup pages, a welcome message, and a call-to-action button redirecting to the authentication page. [Linked Files: `styles.css`, `scripts.js`]

- **auth.html**: This file contains the login and signup interfaces with input fields for email and password. It includes client-side validation and links to the homepage after successful authentication. [Linked Files: `index.html`, `styles.css`, `scripts.js`]

- **homepage.html**: The main page after user authentication, featuring the brand title and multiple sections detailing shoe products. It is well-structured and responsive. [Linked Files: `auth.html`, `styles.css`]

- **styles.css**: Provides styling for all HTML files, ensuring a cohesive theme. It uses media queries for responsiveness. [Linked Files: `index.html`, `auth.html`, `homepage.html`]

- **scripts.js**: Handles client-side authentication using session storage. It includes login/signup operations, input validation, and redirection post-login. [Linked Files: `auth.html`]

- **requirements.txt**: Lists all the client-side dependencies. Currently, the project primarily uses HTML/CSS/JS and doesnâ€™t require a package manager. [No Linked Files]

## Prerequisites

Ensure you have the following software installed on your system:

- A modern web browser (Chrome, Firefox, etc.)
- A code editor (VSCode, Sublime Text, etc.)

## Setup Instructions

1. **Download the Project**

   Clone the repository to your local machine:
   ```bash
   git clone <repository-url>
   ```
   Navigate to the project directory:
   ```bash
   cd shoe_brand_website
   ```

2. **Open the Project**

   Use a web browser to open `index.html` for the landing page or `auth.html` for the login/signup interface.

3. **Authentication**

   Access the `auth.html` file, enter user credentials (email and password), and sign up or log in. Successful login will redirect to `homepage.html`.

## Development Guidelines

- Ensure the HTML is semantic for SEO purposes.
- Maintain a consistent styling theme using the `styles.css`.
- Use the `scripts.js` for any client-side logic regarding session management and user authentication.

## Deployment Instructions

To deploy the site locally:

1. Serve the files using a simple HTTP server. You can start one using Python:
   ```bash
   python -m http.server
   ```
2. Visit `http://localhost:8000` in your web browser.
